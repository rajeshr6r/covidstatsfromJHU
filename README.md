# covidstatsfromJHU

##This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook  ( more a Colab notebook ) 

##This colab notebook is used to download data from Github published by the JHU on COVID Confirmed / Recovered / Deatchs , Vaccinations data into easy consumable files

##I have used some inbuilt pandas methods to cleanup the data to treat missing values and thus enable calculation of daily volumes for the entire period where it was missing earlier due to lack of diligent tracking .
