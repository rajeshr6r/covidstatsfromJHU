# covidstatsfromJHU

## This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook  

You can upload this to [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) and execute from there too.

This colab notebook is used to download data from Github published by the JHU on COVID Confirmed / Recovered / Deatchs , Vaccinations data into easy consumable files

##I have used some inbuilt pandas methods to cleanup the data to treat missing values and thus enable calculation of daily volumes for the entire period where it was missing earlier due to lack of diligent tracking .

## Things to do .

The vaccination data has a nice function that allows individual countries to processed ( which gives accurate numbers ) .

However the Confirmed /Recovered/ Deaths data has some patchwork . I need to adopt the same logic as the vaccination data to ensure uniform treatment .
